Dadi says. They see sheep by the road. 'They look like clouds!' Dadi jumps with joy. Pinky just nods.\n\nThey see a balloon in the shape of an octopus. Dadi claps happily. Pinky doesn't even smile. 'After the dentist's, we will go and have kulfi,' Dadi tries to cheer her up.\n\nIt is noisy at the clinic. There are a lot of men, women, and children waiting for their turn. 'Whose child is this?' the nurse shouts. She is a tall woman. A man picks up the crying boy and sits down. Soon, it is Pinky's turn. But Pinky does not open her mouth. 'If you do not open your mouth, I cannot take the bad tooth out,' the dentist says. Pinky shakes her head.\n\n'Well, why not?' asks the dentist. 'My teeth are made of milk, and they can spill out,' Pinky says, careful not to open her mouth too much, 'I cannot eat bread without my teeth.' The dentist whispers in Pinky's ear. 'You are right, but here's a secret, if you drink a lot of milk, your teeth will always be full of it.' 'Kulfi is also made of milk!' Dadi points out.\n\nPinky can't help but chuckle, forgetting her dental worries for a moment. She opens her mouth, and the dentist gently takes out her milk tooth. It's quick and painless, just like magic.\n\nHow does Pinky feel after the dentist takes out her milk tooth?\nDo you think she was still scared?

The schoolyard buzzed with anticipation about the new smart tablets. Pinky, always curious and adventurous, was brimming with ideas, while Jojo, her brother, was scratching his head, unconvinced.\\n\\n\"Why fix what isn't broken?\" Jojo muttered, looking at his worn-out Maths workbook fondly.\\n\\nPinky laughed, her eyes sparkling, \"Jojo, it's not about fixing. It's about making it even better! Imagine learning Maths with animations!\"\\n\\nBefore they could delve deeper, Sir Riaz, with his gentle smile and wise eyes, called for attention. \"Let's gather around, young minds. Today we'll embark on a discussion journey, weighing the pros and cons of technology in our classroom.\"\\n\\nAs the students formed a circle, Sir Riaz pointed to the tablets gleaming under the morning sun. \"Pinky, please share your thoughts with us first.\"\\n\\nStanding up, Pinky was a picture of enthusiasm. \"Friends, these tablets are doorways to a world of knowledge. They make learning alive! With these, we can see the pyramids of Egypt or the depths of the ocean without leaving our seats!\"\\n\\nObject: Illustration of a speech bubble with text \"What positive aspects of technology is Pinky highlighting? Do you feel the same excitement?\"\\n\\nNot everyone was swayed. Asim, with his thoughtful frown, spoke next. \"I agree that they are fascinating, but my brother says that too much screen time can cause headaches. What about that?\"",

What do you like about real books?\"\n\nPinky, ever the optimist, quickly jumped in. \"But imagine, Jojo, carrying a whole library with you anywhere! And with e-books, we save so many trees!\"\n\nThe debate was in full swing now. Students shared their thoughts, their worries, and their dreams. Sir Riaz listened and then gently guided, \"Think about how these tools can help us learn more, not take over. They should make learning better, not change the good things we already do.\"\n\nThe children nodded, understanding the small difference. They discussed rules for tablet usage, like special screen protectors to prevent eye strain and scheduled breaks to ensure no one spent too long on the device.\n\nObject: Icon of a speech bubble containing the question \"What solutions can we think of to make technology a healthy part of learning?\"\n\nThe story of Taleemabad was becoming an example of progress, with every child adding a little bit to the story of learning with technology. They debated, they disagreed, but most importantly, they learned to listen and consider viewpoints different from their own.\n\nAs the day ended, Sir Riaz concluded, \"Today, you've all shown the wisdom of Taleemabad. You've debated with respect and thought deeply about how technology can be our friend in learning.\"\n\nThe children of Taleemabad left the schoolyard with a new badge of honor.",

    "text": "\\nJourney through the text\n\nReaching for the Stars\nIn Taleemabad, a place full of dreams and adventures, Pinky looked up to Namira Salim, the first Pakistani astronaut, who had just returned from space.\nNamira, a hero to many, started teaching young children about space, including Pinky.\n\nWhen Namira Salim came back from space, she brought stories and lessons from the stars. In Taleemabad, everyone was excited, especially Pinky. Namira became a teacher, sharing her space adventures and teaching about the stars and planets.\n\nWhat did Namira Salim share with the people in Taleemabad?\nPinky joined Namira's classes. She wanted to learn everything about space. Namira taught them about the spacecraft and how every part has a special name. Pinky learned about the 'Oxygen Tank' which helps astronauts breathe, and the 'Main Engine Start' which sets the spacecraft flying.\n\nWhy did Pinky join Namira's classes?\nNamira showed them pictures and models of spacecraft. She explained that every label on them was very important. 'Knowing these labels can help us in space,' Namira said. Pinky listened carefully, remembering each word.\nObject: Illustration of a smiling astronaut with a waving hand, next to a cartoon-style diagram labeled 'Parts of a rocket' with arrows pointing to different parts of the drawn rocket.",

    "text": "Chapter 8\nReaching for the Stars\n\nWhy are the labels on a spacecraft important?\n\nNamira told them that being an astronaut was not just about flying to space. It was about learning and exploring. Pinky felt happy. She now knew that space was not just about stars and planets, but also about learning new things. It makes you realise how big the universe is.\nObject: Illustration of various celestial bodies and a spacecraft amidst stars.\n\nSpace exploration significantly expands our understanding of the universe. It allows scientists to study celestial phenomena, the laws of physics in extreme conditions, and the origins of the universe. This knowledge can provide insights into the history and future of our own planet.\n\nThe challenges of space exploration drive technological advancements that often have practical applications on Earth. Technologies developed for space missions have led to improvements in areas like telecommunications, medical imaging, and material science.\n\nObserving Earth from space also provides critical data on climate change, natural disasters, and environmental degradation. This information is essential for developing strategies to protect our planet.\n\nPinky realised how special Namira's journey was. It was not only about going to space but also about teaching others. Pinky dreamed of her own space adventures, inspired by Namira's stories.",

Use words like 'already', 'just', and 'yet'.\n\nExample, \"I have just learned about galaxies.\"\n\nActivity 2: Making Questions with 'be' Form Verbs\n\nQuestions with 'be' form verbs are super important. They help us ask about things and plans. Remember, the 'be' verbs are 'am', 'is', and 'are'. For example, 'Are you going to the Science Fair?' Let's try making some questions.\n\nWrite three questions using 'be' form verbs. Think about things you might ask your friends or family.\n\nExample, \"Is your favourite planet Mars?\"\n\nActivity 3: Let's create sentences using adverbs!\n\nAdverbs are a type of word that modifies or describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. They often provide information on how, when, where, or to what extent an action is performed.\n\nAdverbs can help to answer questions such as 'how?', 'when?', 'where?', 'to what extent?', or 'why?'. For example, in the sentence 'She ran quickly.', the adverb 'quickly' modifies the verb 'ran' by describing how she ran.\n\nThere are four types of adverbs.",

First, let's have some fun with words that have different sounds, words that describe a person, place or thing, and words that describe our actions. Once we get to know them, we will use them to write a space story. Are you ready? Let's blast off!\n\nActivity: Getting to Know Our Words\n\nLet's go on a word discovery journey, and learn about multi-syllable words, adjectives, and adverbs!\n\nMulti-Syllable Words:\nA syllable is like a beat in a word. For example, in 'rocket,' we have two beats: rock-et. That's two syllables! Multi-syllable words are just words with more than one beat. They can make your story sound interesting and fun.\n\nAdjectives:\nAdjectives are special words that describe nouns. Oh, and a noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea. So, if we have a noun like 'star,' an adjective can describe it, like 'bright star.' Adjectives help make our story colourful and exciting!\n\nAdverbs:\nAdverbs are cool words that sometimes end in 'ly' and they describe how something is done. They add spice to our verbs, which are action words. For example, 'quietly floated' or 'quickly jumped.' Adverbs make our actions in the story more interesting!",
