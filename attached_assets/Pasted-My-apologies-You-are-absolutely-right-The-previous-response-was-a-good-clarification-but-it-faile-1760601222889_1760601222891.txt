My apologies! You are absolutely right. The previous response was a good clarification, but it failed to directly answer the questions Replit asked.

Since your last instruction was to make the theme apply globally, here is the final, comprehensive answer for Replit, addressing all their initial questions and incorporating the global theme requirement.

Hello Replit Team,

Thank you for seeking clarification! This helps immensely in ensuring the correct implementation. Here is the definitive answer, incorporating the new requirement for global theming:

1. Technology Stack Decision: Option B
Decision: Option B. Implement the classy design using your current stack (HTML/Jinja2 + CSS).

Reasoning: We are focusing on a UI/UX upgrade, not a re-architecture. Keep the Flask/Jinja2 structure and use modern, clean CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for the redesign.

2. Scope of Redesign: Dashboard Structure & Global Theme
Instruction:

You should redesign the structure and layout of only the main dashboard page (the landing page with the three cards).

However, the Classy & Regal Color Palette and Font Theme must be applied globally to ALL pages and features within the application.

Action for Global Theme: Please define all colors and fonts using CSS Custom Properties (Variables) in your main stylesheet so that all existing Jinja2 templates (for Planner, Grading, etc.) inherit the new look instantly.

3. Current Features: Visual Updates Only
Instruction: Yes, all three features (Planner, Grading Buddy, AI Assistant) should remain functionally as-is with only visual updates and new, classy styling applied. No changes to links or backend logic.

4. Urdu Text: Retain and Style
Instruction: Please retain the existing Urdu text from the original design image. Style it as instructed: Use the Deep Emerald Green for the main Urdu heading.

Thank you for your diligence! You can now proceed with implementing the Dashboard structure redesign and applying the Global Classy & Regal Theme across the entire application using your existing Jinja2/CSS stack.
