Create a full-stack web application named 'Tutor's Assistant' using Python. The app should have a clean user interface with a pink, yellow, and blue color scheme. The backend should simulate an AI-powered system (using placeholder functions) to handle core tasks.

1. Attendance & Roster Management:

Create a feature that allows a teacher to manually add student names to a class roster.

Implement a simple view for marking students as present or absent. A future AI feature would handle photo-based attendance, but for this prototype, a manual toggle is sufficient.

2. Teacher Planner:

Develop a calendar view (monthly and daily).

Users should be able to click on a date to add a new class entry. Each entry should include a subject and grade level.

Add filtering options to view the schedule by grade level (1-5) and subject (e.g., Urdu, English, Maths, Science).

3. Smart Grading & Assessments:

Create a section for grading. It should display a list of students in the class.

For each student, provide a button to 'upload' a picture of their work (this can be a placeholder button).

The backend should simulate a grading process and log a numerical score under the student's profile for that day.

Include a separate tool to generate mock screeners and quizzes based on user-inputted topics.

4. AI Chatbot for Lesson Planning:

Build a simple chat interface.

When the user types 'hi', the chatbot should respond with a menu of options: 'Help with Lesson Plan', 'Activities', 'Definitions', etc.

Implement a basic conversational flow where the chatbot asks for the subject, grade, and topic before providing a placeholder response.

5. Technical Stack:

Use Python and a web framework like Flask for the backend.

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end to create a responsive, modern user interface.

The backend should use a dictionary or a simple file-based system to store user data, student rosters, and scheduled classes.

Ensure the code is modular and well-commented. The visual design should reflect the specified color scheme."
