Absolutely! A classy color scheme is key to achieving that modern and sophisticated look.

Based on your request for a "classy, modern, and mazedar" design, I'll update the previous prompt with a specific, refined, and professional color palette. This is often referred to as a "Regal & Minimal" scheme.

Replit Prompt: Classy Dashboard UI/UX Overhaul (Updated Color Scheme)
I need your help to completely redesign the dashboard interface for the application "Ustaad Dost." The goal is to make the design feel classy, modern, and highly engaging with an emphasis on a clean, professional, and sophisticated look.

1. Technical Goal & Scope
Goal: Redesign the current dashboard layout and visual style. The original features (Planner, Grading, AI Assistant) must be retained and clearly presented.

Technical Stack: Focus solely on modernizing the Frontend UI/UX using React (functional components), Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, and standard JavaScript/JSX.

2. Classy & Regal Color Palette Instructions
This updated color scheme is the core of the new "classy" look. Please strictly adhere to these color definitions for maximum impact:

Primary Accent (The Regal Tone): Deep Emerald Green or a very dark Teal (#004D40 or similar). This will be used for prominent text, button backgrounds, and key navigation elements.

Highlight Accent (The Classy Pop): Soft Gold/Brass or a muted Mustard Yellow (#C8A35C or similar). This should be used sparingly for the logo accent, subtle borders, and hover effects.

Background/Canvas: Light, Off-White Gray (#F9FAFB or similar). This provides a clean, open, and professional space for the content.

Card/Element Backgrounds: Pure White (#FFFFFF). This creates a sharp, clean separation from the canvas background.

Text: Soft Dark Gray (#374151) for body text for readability, and the Deep Emerald Green for large headings.

3. Design & Styling Instructions
A. Header/Navigation Bar
Style: Slimmer, sticky header with the Soft Gold as a very thin bottom border for elegance.

User Info: Subtle "Welcome" text using the Soft Dark Gray.

Branding: USTAAD DOST text should use the Deep Emerald Green.

B. Main Content Area & Hero
Title: Center the main heading. Use the Deep Emerald Green for the main Urdu text and a smaller font for the English subtitle.

Visual Break: Use a very subtle, faint gradient matching the background colors, or a minimal wave pattern in the off-white area.

C. Feature Cards (Refined & Modern)
Card Style: Use medium rounded corners, a pure white background, and a very subtle, diffused box-shadow.

Action Buttons: Primary call-to-action buttons (Start Planning, Grade Management, AI Assistant) must use the Deep Emerald Green background. On hover, the text should transition to Soft Gold.

Iconography: Use crisp line-art icons. The icons themselves should be rendered in the Deep Emerald Green or highlighted with the Soft Gold accent.

4. Deliverable
Provide the complete React component code for the redesigned dashboard, including the Tailwind CSS classes that implement this new Regal & Minimal color scheme. Focus on creating a single, well-structured component (e.g., Dashboard.js).
